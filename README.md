# Welcome To The LitoList

This LitoList App demonstrates how to utilize local storage...
...to save and retrieve the data, in this case, list states for a user.

## The methods to focus on are...

saveLists() - This selects the lists on the page and saves the innerHTML in local storage
getLists() - This retrieves the stored lists' innerHTML and updates the lists on the page.
